We should experiment with various atoms structures. But our equipment is very bad and we need improve it.
For start we will learn how to recognize simple row structures even without details.
We differ atoms from crystals at two group. One (small) is marked as digits and the other with letters.
First patterns will be simple and the system will recognize only order of digits and letters.
But one more problem -- our recognize computer can store only integers and
convert them into binary format for comparison.
So we need a program to compare a pattern with atom structure.
